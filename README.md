# Hi, I'm Sophia 👋

I'm a computational biologist with a Ph.D. focused on molecular oncology and transcriptomics.  
I spend most of my time wrangling genomic data in R, mining multi-omic datasets, and building scalable pipelines to uncover biological insights.

#### Recent work:
- Predicted drug resistance mechanisms in melanoma using statistical models and validated them in cell culture  
- Developed internal tools for [CNV detection](https://www.github.com/sdegeorgia/CANVAS-summary), [long-read viral integration](https://github.com/sdegeorgia/LAAVA-summary), and [melanoma drug resistance and phenotype switching drivers](https://github.com/sdegeorgia/Melanoma_Drug_Resistance_Data)
- Presented research at international conferences, supported by NSF and NIH fellowships


I'm native in both English 🇺🇸 and German 🇩🇪  
Beyond science, I channel my focus into endurance sports and hands-on problem solving — from triathlon training to home renovations.
