# Hi, I'm Sophia! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computational biologist with a Ph.D. and a strong focus on next-generation sequencing and multi-omics integration. I enjoy building tools and pipelines that help make sense of messy, complex biological data â€” especially when it leads to new insights about how cells behave.

Most of my experience is in R, bash, and Python, working with large-scale genomic datasets to support everything from CRISPR screens to chromatin accessibility and CNV analysis. I like taking problems from raw data all the way through to clean, interpretable results â€” and making those workflows reproducible for the rest of the team.

At the end of the day, I love digging into the data to figure out what it's really trying to say.

#### Recent work:
- Predicted drug resistance mechanisms in melanoma using statistical models and validated them in cell culture  
- Developed internal tools for [CNV detection](https://www.github.com/sdegeorgia/CANVAS-summary), [long-read viral integration](https://github.com/sdegeorgia/LAAVA-summary), and [melanoma drug resistance and phenotype switching drivers](https://github.com/sdegeorgia/Melanoma_Drug_Resistance_Data)
- Presented research at international conferences, supported by NSF and NIH fellowships


I'm native in both English ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ and German ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª  
Beyond science, I channel my focus into endurance sports and hands-on problem solving â€” from triathlon training to home renovations.
