# Hi, I'm Sophia ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computational biologist with a Ph.D. focused on molecular oncology and transcriptomics.  
I spend most of my time wrangling genomic data in R, mining multi-omic datasets, and building scalable pipelines to uncover biological insights.

#### Recent work:
- Predicted drug resistance mechanisms in melanoma using statistical models and validated them in cell culture  
- Developed internal tools for CNV detection, long-read viral integration, and ATAC-seq pipelines  
- Presented research at international conferences, supported by NSF and NIH fellowships

ðŸ”§ Tools I use often:
`Snakemake` â€¢ `R` â€¢ `Python` â€¢ `Bash` â€¢ `Docker` â€¢ `LSF` â€¢ `ggplot2` â€¢ `long-read seq` â€¢ `Control-FREEC` â€¢ `CRISPR`

I'm native in both English ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ and German ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª  
Beyond science, I channel my focus into endurance sports and hands-on problem solving â€” from triathlon training to home renovations.
